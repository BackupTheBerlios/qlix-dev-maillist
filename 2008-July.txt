Subject: [Qlix-dev] Qlix Crashes
Message-ID: <48857286.9020004@gmail.com>

FYI... Upon opening qlix with MTP device connected, it crashes.

Creative Zen 32G SSD... works with mtp-tools, and other apps such as
Gnomad2, etc.

qlix version: 0.2.4-0ubuntu-1~ppa1
mtp-tools: 0.2.6.1-2ubuntu1
libmtp7: 0.2.6.1-2ubuntu1


$ qlix
